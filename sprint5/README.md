<p>This is Requirement 1-3 completed. This utilizes Google Cloud Functions to run a service that provides quiz questions 
to a client program that will be developed later. So far there are two Cloud Functions. Function1 provides the
amount of question banks there are, the ID of that bank, and the number of questions per bank. Function2 provides the 
appropriate number of questions and potential answers for each question bank. All data for the Questions and Banks are stored
in the data.json file.</p>

<p>To run. This will not be the final product.</p>
`go run main.go`
